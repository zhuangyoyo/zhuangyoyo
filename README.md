I'm Yoyo, a CS student @ UWaterloo passionate about building accessible solutions to tackle real-world problems.

In the past, I've interned at BusPlanner where I launched several security initiatives including 2FA, user action logging and client-server data encryption to protect the sensitive information of 2M students across North America. Previously, I also worked as an Optimization Engineer and Coding Instructor at Code Ninjas, where I spearheaded a web app initiative for parents and staff to book birthday parties and coding session for their kids and taught kids ages 4-14 essential coding skills in C#, JavaScript, Unity and LUA.

Feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn if you want to connect!
